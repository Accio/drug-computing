    "Conveniently, Python comes with modules that enable one to read and write a number of popular compressed formats in an almost completely transparent manner.  Two formats are recommended: the Gzip format, which achieves reasonable compression and is fast, and the Bzip2 format, which achieves higher compression but at the expense of speed.  Both formats are standardized, open, can be read by most common decompression programs, and are single-file based, meaning they compress a single file, not cabinets or archives of multiple files, which complicates things.\n",

    "Classes can be an extremely convenient way for organizing data in scientific programs.  However, this benefit does not come without a cost: oftentimes stratifying data across a class will slow your program considerably.  Consider the atom class defined above.  We could put a separate position or velocity vector inside each atom instance.  However, when we perform calculations that make intense use of these quantities—such as a pairwise loop that computes all interatomic distances—it is inefficient for Python to jump around in memory accessing individual position variables in each class.  Rather, it would be much more efficient to store all positions for all atoms in a single large array that occupies one location in memory.  In this case, we would consider those quantities that appear in the slowest step of our calculations (typically the pairwise loop) and keep them outside of the classes as large, easily manipulated arrays and then put everything else that is not accessed frequently (such as the element name) inside the class definitions.  Such a separation may seem messy, but ultimately it is essential if we are to achieve reasonable performance in numeric computations."
