    "# A brief, basic introduction to Python for scientific computing - Chapter 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction/Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an extremely usable, high-level programming language that is quickly becoming a standard in scientific computing.  It is open source, completely standardized across different platforms (Windows / MacOS / Linux), immensely flexible, and easy to use and learn.  Programs written in Python are highly readable and often much shorter than comparable programs written in other languages like C or Fortran.  Moreover, Python comes pre-loaded with standard modules that provide a huge array of functions and algorithms, for tasks like parsing text data, manipulating and finding files on disk, reading/writing compressed files, and downloading data from web servers.  Python is also capable of all of the complex techniques that advanced programmers expect, like object orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is somewhat different than languages like C, C++, or Fortran.  In the latter, source code must first be compiled to an executable format before it can be run.  In Python, there is no compilation step; instead, source code is interpreted on the fly in a line-by-line basis.  That is, Python executes code as if it were a script.  The main advantage of an interpreted language is that it is flexible; variables do not need to be declared ahead of time, and the program can adapt on-the-fly.  The main disadvantage, however, is that numerically-intensive programs written in Python typically run slower than those in compiled languages.  This would seem to make Python a poor choice for scientific computing; however, time-intensive subroutines can be compiled in C or Fortran and imported into Python in such a manner that they appear to behave just like normal Python functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, many common mathematical  and numerical routines have been pre-compiled to run very fast and grouped into two packages that can be added to Python in an entirely transparent manner.  The NumPy (Numeric Python) package provides basic routines for manipulating large arrays and matrices of numeric data.  The SciPy (Scientific Python) package extends the functionality of NumPy with a substantial collection of useful algorithms, like minimization, Fourier transformation, regression, and other applied mathematical techniques.  Both of these packages are also open source and growing in popularity in the scientific community.  With NumPy and SciPy, Python become comparable to, perhaps even more competitive than, expensive commercial packages like MatLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover the Python 3.x language version. Some packages still use the 2.7 series, but support is being dropped and modern packages must move to the 3.x series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python, one must install the base interpreter.  In addition, there are a number of applications that provide a nice GUI-driven editor for writing Python programs.  Currently the preferred method of installing Python on most platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows) is the Anaconda Python distribution, which is free and provides a wide variety of standard scientific Python packages as well as a built in package manager called `conda` which makes it easy to install a variety of other packages you might need. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes standard with extensive documentation.  This can typically be accessed via built-in help, such as typing `help` on the Python prompt. One can search through function and module definitions, or find general information on the language using the table of contents.  The entire manual, and many other helpful documents and links, can also be found at:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://docs.python.org\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python development community also maintains an extensive wiki.  In particular, for programming beginners, there are several pages of tutorials and help at:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who have had some programming experience and don't need to start learning Python from scratch, the Dive Into Python website is an excellent tutorial that can teach you most of the basics in a few hours:\n",

    "## Jupyter notebooks and the format of THIS document\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is formatted as a Jupyter notebook; Jupyter is a convenient way of running Python within your web browser, interspersed with documents and other types of images.\n",
    "Basic elements in Jupyter notebooks are cells (such as this one) which can hold \"markdown\" formatted text (plain text with special formatting symbols) or code (Python code, specifically); the former is simply displayed, while the latter can be run.\n",
    "Code blocks can typically be \"run\" to display the output of Python commands, so you should be able to run the examples in what follows and modify them as you like. Here is a sample code block; try it out by clicking on it and hitting shift-enter to evaluate it (or by clicking the \"run cell\" button at the top of your screen)."
