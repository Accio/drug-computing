    "#Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an extremely usable, high-level programming language that is quickly becoming a standard in scientific computing.  It is open source, completely standardized across different platforms (Windows / MacOS / Linux), immensely flexible, and easy to use and learn.  Programs written in Python are highly readable and often much shorter than comparable programs written in other languages like C or Fortran.  Moreover, Python comes pre-loaded with standard modules that provide a huge array of functions and algorithms, for tasks like parsing text data, manipulating and finding files on disk, reading/writing compressed files, and downloading data from web servers.  Python is also capable of all of the complex techniques that advanced programmers expect, like object orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is somewhat different than languages like C, C++, or Fortran.  In the latter, source code must first be compiled to an executable format before it can be run.  In Python, there is no compilation step; instead, source code is interpreted on the fly in a line-by-line basis.  That is, Python executes code as if it were a script.  The main advantage of an interpreted language is that it is flexible; variables do not need to be declared ahead of time, and the program can adapt on-the-fly.  The main disadvantage, however, is that numerically-intensive programs written in Python typically run slower than those in compiled languages.  This would seem to make Python a poor choice for scientific computing; however, time-intensive subroutines can be compiled in C or Fortran and imported into Python in such a manner that they appear to behave just like normal Python functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, many common mathematical  and numerical routines have been pre-compiled to run very fast and grouped into two packages that can be added to Python in an entirely transparent manner.  The NumPy (Numeric Python) package provides basic routines for manipulating large arrays and matrices of numeric data.  The SciPy (Scientific Python) package extends the functionality of NumPy with a substantial collection of useful algorithms, like minimization, Fourier transformation, regression, and other applied mathematical techniques.  Both of these packages are also open source and growing in popularity in the scientific community.  With NumPy and SciPy, Python become comparable to, perhaps even more competitive than, expensive commercial packages like MatLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover the Python 2.7 language version.  A new language version, the 3.0 series, also exists, but breaks compatibility with the earlier versions of the language.  The 2.7 series is currently the standard for scientific computing efforts in Python.\n"

    "#Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python, one must install the base interpreter.  In addition, there are a number of applications that provide a nice GUI-driven editor for writing Python programs.  For Windows platforms, I prefer to use the freely available Python(x,y) installation and the included Spyder editor.  This single package includes virtually all tools one would need for scientific Python computing, and can be downloaded at:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.pythonxy.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the installation executable and proceed through the automated setup.  If you want to save space, you do not need to install all of the add-on packages during installation.  The main recommended packages are Python, NumPy, SciPy, Spyder, IPython, Matplotlib, VPython, MinGW, and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not use Python(x,y), you should install the following software:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPython at http://www.python.org/.  Be sure to install the 2.7 series.\n",
