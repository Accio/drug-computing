    "Functions are an important part of any program.  Some programming languages make a distinction between \"functions\" that return values and \"subroutines\" that do not return anything but rather do something.  In Python, there is only one kind, functions, but these can return single, multiple, or no values at all.  In addition, like everything else, functions in Python are objects.  That means that they can be included in lists, tuples, or dictionaries, or even sent to other functions.  This makes Python extraordinarily flexible.\n",

    "Here, `def` signals the creation of a new function named `add`, which takes two arguments.  All of the commands associated with this function are then indented underneath the `def` statement, similar to the syntactic indentation used in loops.  The `return` statement tells Python to do two things: exit the function and, if a value is provided, use that as the `return` value -- the value given back to the user or to the code which calls the function.\n",
