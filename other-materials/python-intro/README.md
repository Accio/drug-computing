# Introduction to Python

This material provides an introduction to Python for scientific computing, in a Jupyter notebook format.

## Origins
This is adapted (by permission) from [material](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf) originally authored by M. Scott Shell (UCSB), with adjustments and fixes by David Mobley.
It was ported to the Jupyter notebook format by Kevin Hoang, an undergraduate in the Mobley lab.

## Manifest

- [`Intro_1.ipynb`](Intro_1.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 1. Getting started, Jupyter notebooks, and the interactive interpreter.
- [`Intro_2.ipynb`](Intro_2.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 2. Common object types in Python; basic math; strings and lists, list operations.
- [`Intro_3.ipynb`](Intro_3.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 3. Tuples, immutable objects, assignment and name binding, string manipulation, conditionals, loops.
- [`Intro_4.ipynb`](Intro_4.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 4. Functions, namespaces, scripts, and modules (standard and your own).
  - [`primes.py`](primes.py): Sample script utilized in Chapter 4.
  - [`test.py`](test.py): Example module utilized in Chapter 4.
- [`Intro_5.ipynb`](Intro_5.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 5. Reading from/working with files, binary data, file system functions, classes, exception handling, and profiling.
  - [`data.txt`](data.txt): Supporting data file utilized in Chapter 5.
  - [`program.py`](program.py): Very simple test program from Chapter 5.
