# Introduction to Python

This material provides an introduction to Python for scientific computing in a Jupyter notebook format, as well as a very brief but more conceptual introduction to Python in purely written form.

## Origins

### Jupyter notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks here are adapted (by permission) from [material](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf) originally authored by M. Scott Shell (UCSB), with adjustments and fixes by David Mobley.
They were ported to the Jupyter notebook format by Kevin Hoang, an undergraduate in the Mobley lab.

### Python crash course

The python crash course material provided here was written by David Mobley.

## Manifest
- [`python_crashcourse.md`](python_crashcourse.md): Written material providing some basics of Python, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.
- [`Intro_1.ipynb`](Intro_1.ipynb): Jupyter notebook Chapter 1.
