# PharmSci 175/275 Assigned Materials

This details (and links to, when possible) materials covered in PharmSci 175/275, and can be used together with the detailed schedule posted on EEE Canvas, to see exactly what you should be doing when.

Please note that materials which are specific to the undergraduate or graduate versions are indicated with (175) or (275) in parentheses, respectively, and materials which have no such indication are required for all students.

## Materials by lecture number

### Before the course starts
Before the course starts, you should do the following:
- Read [`docs/why_computing.md`](docs/why_computing.md), a brief background document on why we are starting where we are
- Follow the steps in [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) to install the software you need, deviating to pick up background info on Linux/BASH if you need.
- Visit the [Python intro](../other-materials/python-intro/README.md) in [`../other-materials`](../other-materials) and check out the Jupyter notebooks and [Python crashcourse](../other-materials/python-intro/python_crashcourse.md) available there to make sure your Python is ready for the course.
- Try out a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)

### Before Lecture 1 ([Python and Linux](lectures/Python_Linux_Vi))
To prepare for Lecture 1, on Python, Linux, text editors, and GitHub, please:
- Download the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/mobleylab/drug-computing) from GitHub (download as a zip file if you like, or if you have used `git` before, feel free to clone the repository instead)
- Take a quick look through the slides in `uci-pharmsci/lectures/Python_Linux_Vi`; try viewing as a Jupyter notebook via `jupyter notebook Lec1_Python_Linux_Vi.ipynb` (interactive) but if you have trouble with this, you can view the equivalent HTML file in your web browser
- Make note of any questions to bring up in class, and also visit the Python materials above as needed.
- Ideally create a (free) GitHub account in case there are issues with the course materials that you want to bring up on the GitHub repository, which houses most of our course materials.

### Before Lecture 2 ([Energy landscapes and energy minimization](lectures/energy_minimization))
- Read the energy minimization Jupyter notebook/slides in [`uci-pharmsci/lectures/energy_minimization/energy_minimization.ipynb`](uci-pharmsci/lectures/energy_minimization/energy_minimization.ipynb)

### Before Lecture 3 ([3D structure and shape](lectures/3D_structure_shape))
- If you don't already have a chemistry drawing tool like ChemDraw that you like, you may wish to download and install [MarvinSketch](https://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin) for free from ChemAxon. (Though in a pinch, you can use the web demo version linked from the lecture slides if you need.)
- Read the 3D structure/shape Jupyter notebook [`uci-pharmsci/lectures/3D_structure_shape/3D_Structure_Shape.ipynb`](uci-pharmsci/lectures/3D_structure_shape/3D_Structure_Shape.ipynb)

## Before Lecture 4 ([QM](lectures/QM))
- Skim through the PDF of the slides, noting any questions (though these provide theoretical background for subsequent classes so they are unfortunately not interactive)
- If you desire to try a sample QM calculation, open up the Psi4 example (`psi4_example.html` or `psi4_example.ipynb`) and get psi4 installed in a suitable virtual environment as per the instructions there.

## Before Lecture 5 ([MD](lectures/MD)):
- Skim through PDF of the slides, noting any questions for discussion in class
- Review MD sandbox Jupyter notebook in the same directory

## Before Lecture 6 ([MC](lectures/MC)):
- Spend some time with the MD sandbox from Lecture 5
- Skim through the PDF of the MD (part II)/MC slides in the `MC` directory, noting any questions for discussion in class
- Review the MC sandbox Jupyter notebook in the same directory

## Before Lecture 7 ([Solvation](lectures/solvation)):
- Read the Jupyter notebook in the `solvation` directory under lectures.

## Before Lecture 8 ([Docking, scoring and pose prediction](lectures/docking_scoring_pose)):
- Read the `docking.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in the relevant directory and `old_slides.pdf` there, from the slide numbered 11 (bottom left corner) onwards.

## Before Lecture 9 ([Library searching](library_searching)):
- Skim the [PDF of the slides](library_searching/Library_lingo_lecture.pdf)
- Check out the relevant sandbox, `Library_searching_and_lingo_sandbox.ipynb`, in the relevant directory.

## Before Lecture 10 ([Ligand-based design](ligand_based_design)):
- Skim the [PDF of the slides](ligand_based_design/ligand_based_design_slides.pdf)
- Try out the Jupyter notebook, `ligand_based_design.ipynb`, in teh relevant directory.

## Before Lecture 11 ([Empirical models/physical properties/QSAR](empirical_physical_properties)):
- Skim the [PDF of the slides](empirical_physical_properties/physprops.pdf) and come with questions/comments

## Before Lecture 12 ([Fluctuations, correlations, error analysis](fluctuations_correlations_error)):
- Skim the PDF of the slides and come with questions/comments

## Before Lecture 13 ([Fluctuations, correlations, error analysis](fluctuations_correlations_error)):
- Skim through the [Jupyter notebook](error_anlaysis_OpenMM_convergence.ipynb)
- Try to get a sample density calculation running on your computer
- If time allows, think about the optional exercise just following the density calculation
