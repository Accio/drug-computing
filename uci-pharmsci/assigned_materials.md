# PharmSci 175/275 Assigned Materials

This details (and links to, when possible) materials covered in PharmSci 175/275, and can be used together with the detailed schedule posted on EEE Canvas, to see exactly what you should be doing when.

Please note that materials which are specific to the undergraduate or graduate versions are indicated with (175) or (275) in parentheses, respectively, and materials which have no such indication are required for all students.

## Materials by lecture number

### Before the course starts
Before the course starts, you should do the following:
- Read [`docs/why_computing.md`](docs/why_computing.md), a brief background document on why we are starting where we are
- Follow the steps in [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) to install the software you need, deviating to pick up background info on Linux/BASH if you need.
- Visit the [Python intro](../other-materials/python-intro/README.md) in [`../other-materials`](../other-materials) and check out the Jupyter notebooks and [Python crashcourse](../other-materials/python-intro/python_crashcourse.md) available there to make sure your Python is ready for the course.
- Try out a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)

### Before Lecture 1 ([Python and Linux](lectures/Python_Linux_Vi))
To prepare for Lecture 1, on Python, Linux, text editors, and GitHub, please:
- Download the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/mobleylab/drug-computing) from GitHub (download as a zip file if you like, or if you have used `git` before, feel free to clone the repository instead)
- Take a quick look through the slides in `uci-pharmsci/lectures/Python_Linux_Vi`; try viewing as a Jupyter notebook via `jupyter notebook Lec1_Python_Linux_Vi.ipynb` (interactive) but if you have trouble with this, you can view the equivalent HTML file in your web browser
- Make note of any questions to bring up in class, and also visit the Python materials above as needed.
- Ideally create a (free) GitHub account in case there are issues with the course materials that you want to bring up on the GitHub repository, which houses most of our course materials.

### Before Lecture 2 ([Energy landscapes and energy minimization](lectures/energy_minimization))

### Before Lecture 3 ([3D structure and shape](lectures/3D_structure_shape))
- If you don't already have a chemistry drawing tool like ChemDraw that you like, download and install [MarvinSketch](https://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin) for free from ChemAxon.
