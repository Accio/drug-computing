### Before the course starts

Before Lecture 1, you should do the following:
- Read [`docs/why_computing.md`][docs/why_computing.md], a brief background document on why we are starting where we are
- Follow the steps in [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) to install the software you need, deviating to pick up background info on Linux/BASH if you need.
- Visit the [Python intro](../other_materials/python-intro/README.md) in [`../other_materials`] and check out the Jupyter notebooks and [Python crashcourse](../other_materials/python-intro/python_crashcourse.md) avaialble there to make sure your Python is ready for the course.
- Try out a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
