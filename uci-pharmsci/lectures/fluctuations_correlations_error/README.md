# Fluctuations, correlations and error analysis

This includes content for both lectures on fluctuations, correlations, and error analysis.

For the first lecture, content is primarily in `fluct_corr_error.pdf` (and associated Keynote). The second lecture's content is entirely in `error_analysis_openMM_convergence.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) and associated HTML.

Credit for the materials is given in the content itself; the latter draws heavily on material from the `images` directory which also gives credit there.
