# Fluctuations, correlations and error analysis

This includes content for both lectures on fluctuations, correlations, and error analysis.

For the first lecture, content is primarily in `fluct_corr_error.pdf` (and associated Keynote). The second lecture's content is entirely in `error_analysis_openMM_convergence.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) and associated HTML.

Credit for the materials is given in the content itself; the latter draws heavily on material from the `images` directory which also gives credit there.


## Manifest:

### Primary files:
- `fluct_corr_error`: Keynote and PDF format version of first lecture on fluctuations, correlations and error analysis
- `error_analysis_openMM_convergence.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook of second lecture on fluctuations, correlations, and error analysis, including density calculation example/analysis (using OpenMM).
- `density.py`: Example density calculation that builds on that in the `error_analysis_openMM_convergence.ipynb` file; used to generate sample density data analyzed there (and deposited here in `sample_files`)

### Other files:
- `supporting`: Directory with some supplementary files used generating plots shown in the lecture
- `sample_files`: Sample files generated by or used in the Jupyter notebook and/or density calculations
