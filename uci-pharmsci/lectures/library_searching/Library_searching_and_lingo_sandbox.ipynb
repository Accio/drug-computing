    "## SMILES in general are not unique\n",
    "In general, there is NOT a 1-1 correspondence between a SMILES string and a molecule. Rather, several SMILES strings can typically be written which correspond to the same chemical compound. Normally this is helpful, as the user wishing to specify a compound doesn't have to provide the *right* SMILES in order to identify the molecule they want. This also makes sense when we consider chemical names, which have a similar property (several names may correspond to one compound).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sometimes this non-uniqueness is undesirable\n",
    "Suppose you're faced with a large corporate compound library and you want to apply some method to select a portion of this for experimental follow-up. However, you're aware that there may be duplicate compounds (under different names or identifiers) in the library. How do you check for (and rule out) these duplicates so your experimental group doesn't involve running duplicate assays except when they want to? You can't use SMILES OR names since neither of these corresponds 1-1 to particular molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a fix - a *canonical SMILES string*, which is basically a standardized way of writing SMILES strings. OpenEye's tools can assign these (and in fact that's what we generated above -- canonical SMILES strings) to molecules, and they DO have a 1-1 correspondence to particular compounds. So if you create canonical SMILES strings for all of your compounds, you can then check that these are unique within your set, and filter out duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chirality poses another hurdle for SMILES\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard SMILES strings do not denote molecular chirality. This is a major limitation, since it would prevent a 1-1 correspondence between SMILES and molecules for all chiral molecules AND it would prevent SMILES strings from uniquely identifying particular isomers or enantiomers of chiral compounds. Fortunately, there is a solution -- *isomeric* SMILES strings, which clearly indicate the chirality/isomeric state of the specified molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of ofloxacin, an antibacterial drug with one particular isomer which is more active than the other. Specifically, levofloxacin is more active/effective than ofloxacin (which is a racemic mixture of the two isomers). Let's generate both from their names and compare SMILES strings.\n",
