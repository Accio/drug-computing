# PharmSci 175/275 Lecture Materials

This provides in-class materials for lectures and interactive sessions for PharmSci 175/275.

## Lectures and Jupyter notebooks

Lectures and course materials use the Jupyter notebook format which allows easy mixing of code, text, images, and other materials, so you will need to have Jupyter notebooks working to make usef of the materials provided here.


## Organization

This is organized into sub-directories based on the teaching topic, with the topics presented in the typical numerical order below but file organization done by name.
Since the material will typically draw from external files, you are recommended to either obtain the entire repository or at least a copy of the relevant day's directory.

## Instructional content
