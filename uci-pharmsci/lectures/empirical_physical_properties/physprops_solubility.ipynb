    "# This is a sandbox/preface for the solubility calculation assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The solubility calculation assignment focuses on building a simple linear solubility model which attempts to predict solubilities for a series of new compounds based on a model trained on a set of compounds with known solubilities. To put it another way, we have a test set and a training set, and want to use the known solubilities from the training set to predict solubilities for the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "## For solubility prediction, we'll use a series of *descriptors*\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are properties of our molecule which might (or might not) be related to the solubility. For example, we might think that solubility will in general tend to go down as molecular weight goes up, and go up as polarity increases (or go down as polarity decreases) and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, let's take a sample molecule and calculate a series of descriptors which we might want to use in constructing a simple solubility model. "
