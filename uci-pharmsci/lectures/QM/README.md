# Quantum mechanics overview

## Authors
Lecture content here authored by David L. Mobley (UCI) drawing heavily on material from M. Scott Shell (UCSB); updated (in Powerpoint version) by Victoria Tran Lim.

## Manifest
- `QM_slides`: Lecture slides (this one does not use a Jupyter notebook) in [Keynote](QM_slides.key) and [PDF format](QM_slides.pdf) and Powerpoint format. **Important note: PPT file was material actually presented by Victoria Tran Lim and contains updates not in the other content**; I was out sick.
- `psi4_example`: Example of using psi4 for some very simple QM calculations, adapted from a workshop example (as noted in the text). Available in Jupyter notebook format (`.ipynb`) and HTML format (`.html`).
