# Visualization with PyMol and VMD

This directory contains content relating to visualization with both PyMol and VMD.
VMD is more commonly used for visualization of molecular simulations; however, PyMol is perhaps a better general-purpose viewer for biomolecules if you are not visualizing simulations.
As of the 2017-2018 school year we are shifting to primarily instructing on use of VMD; however, legacy material on PyMol is also provided here, and students may choose either piece of software for use in the class and for (if selected) the visualization assignment.

## Manifest
(Keynote note: The large Keynote files in this directory present only as small placeholders if you cloned the repository with normal `git`; to obtain them you would need to install `git-lfs` and then use `git-lfs pull` to obtain the files. Otherwise only placeholder files will be present.)

- `PyMol`: Keynote and PDF; old lecture content relating to PyMol usage, by David Mobley.
- `VMD`: Keynote and PDF; 2018 lecture content relating to VMD usage, by Nathan Lim.
- `pymol_files`: Supplemental files relating to the PyMol lecture (e.g. sample movie files referenced therein)
