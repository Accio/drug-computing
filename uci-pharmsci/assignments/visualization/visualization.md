# Visualization assignment


## Background

This was originally written as an assignment for PyMol, but it may be done with either PyMol or VMD with very slight adaptations as noted below.

This assignment assumes you have already installed a suitable molecular viewer (PyMol or VMD) and worked through the movie tutorial posted on the course GitHub. If you have not done so you should do so now.
Posted notes/tutorials take you through a variety of background material and you are expected to have consulted these before tackling this assignment.

Don’t hesitate to ask with questions, but if you ask something which is already addressed in the notes on GitHub, don’t be surprised to be pointed back there.

## Your assignment
Pick a topic involving functional biomolecules and structural data, from your research (including your simulations), or from your reading of the literature.
Make a PyMol or VMD movie about the topic, possibly also illustrated with stills and illustrations, and turn it in along with a brief report (0.5-2 page) explaining what I (or your audience) should see, and what I can learn from it.
Your report should effectively narrate the movie and teach me something scientifically. For example, you might choose to make a movie about HIV protease inhibitors and how they occupy the substrate binding site, identifying key interactions they make with the protease and other important structural features, both with a movie and a set of still images.
Again, your report would effectively narrate the movie/stills. (Do not use examples which were used in class.)

Typically, the major place to lose points on this assignment is to (a) not include all of the required elements in your movie, or (b) to submit a writeup which describes the system generally but has no connection to the move, or (c) provide a movie which does not highlight anythign specific about the system but just shows it and says what it is.
The point of this assignment is NOT just to make a nice movie, but to make a nice movie that illustrates something -- for example, a movie you might use in a talk about your research or someone else’s research.

Your movie should involve, at minimum:
- (If using PyMol): A morph between at least two views of the molecule (such as a rotation or zoom)
- At least one change of representation

You may also want to use other elements, such as changes in transparency, changes in color, or even changes in what is visible (for example, you could reveal a ligand in a binding site, having it initially invisible). You may also want to highlight hydrogen bonds or measure certain distances to highlight key interactions.
Ideally, your movie should focus around some points you want to make based on what you know about the science for the system.

For your movie, the final product is up to you -- the point is to understand a scientific point you want to make, and illustrate it using molecular visualization focused on the points you want to make.

You will need to save the movie file.

Your final grade will be based on whether your movie effectively shows what is going on in the system and on its connection with your written explanation. For full credit, your movie should include the elements noted above, and make several scientific points which you explain clearly in your narrative. You will lose credit if your narrative and movie are disconnected (i.e. if the narrative doesn’t explain what I should learn from the movie).
To help with this, you should find a tutorial posted on the course website, as well as some examples and slides.

## Submission

You can submit your writeup and movie via Canvas if the file size is small.
However, movies are often large, and it may be easier to submit your writeup via Canvas and share the movie via a link in your writeup which points to Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, or similar. (Note that all UCI Google accounts come with a huge amount of Google Drive storage for free, so you should easily be able to store the file there and share a link.)
