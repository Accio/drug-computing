#### Cheatsheets and dotfiles
Under the **uci-pharmasci/docs/** directory, I've included some useful command cheat sheets for [BASH](https://github.com/nathanmlim/blues-apps/tree/master/docs/bash_cheatsheet.jpg) and [vi](https://github.com/nathanmlim/blues-apps/tree/master/docs/vi_cheatsheet.pdf).

We also have a [Github](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s26/sh/ae73a67b-4d7a-4e97-a896-cef5473db895/178762935c73b559) cheat sheet/tutorial on our group Evernote. I also recommend checking out the [CodeAcademy Github](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) tutorial.

I've included some of my _dotfiles_ which may come in handy. Copy these to your HOME directory in GreenPlanet (and your local machine if needed).
