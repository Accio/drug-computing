# Content relating to UCI's PharmSci 175/275, Drug Discovery Computing Techniques

## What's here
This will provide course materials for UCI's PharmSci 175 and 275 courses, which are currently taught in parallel, with 175 being the undergraduate version.
This will ultimately contain syllabus information, lecture notes and slides, required reading, sandboxes and examples used in class, and assignments.

## Manifest
- `getting-started.md`: (will) provide information on basic software requirements for the class and where to get started
- `syllabus.md`: Syllabus for PharmSci 175/275
- `175`: Undergraduate course (PharmSci 175)-specific materials (e.g. assignments)
- `275`: Graduate course (PharmSci 275)-specific materials (e.g. assignments)

#### Cheatsheets and dotfiles
Under the **uci-pharmasci/docs/** directory, I've included some useful command cheat sheets for [BASH](https://github.com/nathanmlim/blues-apps/tree/master/docs/bash_cheatsheet.jpg) and [vi](https://github.com/nathanmlim/blues-apps/tree/master/docs/vi_cheatsheet.pdf).

We also have a [Github](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s26/sh/ae73a67b-4d7a-4e97-a896-cef5473db895/178762935c73b559) cheat sheet/tutorial on our group Evernote. I also recommend checking out the [CodeAcademy Github](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) tutorial.

I've included some of my _dotfiles_ which may come in handy. Copy these to your HOME directory in GreenPlanet (and your local machine if needed).
